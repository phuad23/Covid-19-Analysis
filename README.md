i worked on this project as my final project to earn the Data Analyst [Certification](https://github.com/phuad23/Covid-19-Analysis/blob/main/Techy%20Jaunt%20Data%20Analysis%20Certificate.PNG) with TechyJaunt.

The analysis was for the covid 19 pandemic that happened among the 226 countries in the world.

The is the [Dataset](https://github.com/phuad23/Covid-19-Analysis/blob/main/Covid%2019%20workable.xlsx) that was used for the analysis.

##Below are the Questions that was asked
1. Determine the top 5 countries with the highest total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths
2. Compare the total number of cases and deaths across continents to identify which continent has been most affected by the pandemic
3. Determine which countries have the highest death percentages
4. Analyze basic insights like total cases, total deaths.
5. Determine the Death Percentage by continent
6. Determine the Population by Total cases by Country.

The Data was cleaned using Microsoft Excel before laoding the Data to Microsoft PowerBi for Data Visualization.

The Analysis was carried out while the Visualization was done with Microsoft PowerBi.
